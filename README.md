# Laptop

Laptop is a script to set up an macOS laptop for web and mobile development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Requirements

We support:

- macOS High Sierra (10.13)
- macOS Mojave (10.14)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
wget https://github.com/danielriley06/laptop/archive/master.zip -P ~ && unzip -a ~/master.zip && rm -rf ~/master.zip && cd laptop-master
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
less setup
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```bash
bash setup 2>&1 | tee ~/setup.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/setup.log
```

## Debugging

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
